# 3.3. Signals in the Sauce

import Question from '@site/src/components/Question';

A recipe is only as good as its ingredientsâ€”and so are your traces. In this lab, you'll extract ingredient names as span attributes for the catalog service. The result? Traces that are flavorful and easy to follow.

## Extracting attributes

We currently receive spans with paths in the name like `GET /api/ingredients/pineapple` from the catalog service. For this challenge, we want to extract the ingredient portion of the URL to a span attribute named `ingredient`.

:::tip[Documentation Reference]

The documentation for the [OpenTelemetry Collector span processor](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/otelcol/otelcol.processor.span/#rename-a-span-name-and-adding-attributes) may prove useful for this challenge, but this doesn't discount the use of other components.

:::

1.  Edit the **lab_receive_telemetry** pipeline and add your new component.

1.  Create your span processor component 
    <details>
        <summary>Need a hint?</summary>

        Check out this [example from the docs](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/otelcol/otelcol.processor.span/#keep-the-original-span-name). By crafting a regular expression for the span names, we can extract the ingredient as an attribute and remove it from the name (reducing cardinality)

        **Tip:** [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) is a great way to test regular expressions interactively (use the `Golang` flavor).

            It happens to the best of us. Here is a pattern that will capture the ingredient from the URL:
            ```
            rules = [`^GET \/api\/ingrediens\/(?P<ingredient>.+)$`]
            ```

            Note that using `` `backticks` `` allows us to define string literals in Alloy. This avoids the backslashes in our regular expression from being interpreted by Alloy.

1.  **Save** the pipeline and confirm to roll out changes.

1.  Try using Alloy's live debugging UI to confirm if your updates worked. You may want to create a few recipes if you're not seeing spans.

1.  We can also confirm this using `Explore Traces` and some TraceQL!
    1.  Navigate to `Explore` in the left navigation of Grafana Cloud.

    1.  Type `traces` into the **Datasources** box and select the one containing your username (i.e. _not_ `demoinfra`).
    
    1.  Run the query below to see a count of requests by ingredient:
        ```
        {.service.name = "catalog" && .ingredient != ""} | count_over_time() by (.ingredient)
        ```
